This project creates an ESP32 device using the ArduinoHA library from https://github.com/dawidchyrzynski/arduino-home-assistant for running
Home Assistant discovery protocol to register this new device automatically.

This device has a RGB LED simulating three lights in different rooms, and a DHT22 sensor to get the home temperature and humidity.
